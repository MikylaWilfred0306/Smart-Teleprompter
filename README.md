The smart-teleprompter is a website that allows a logged in user to edit text files as well as teleprompt them straight to the screen. A teleprompter is used by newscasters and other media professionals to read scripts while still looking at or near the camera. My project uses this concept creating a page that defaults to white font on a black background that can scroll through the script. The website allows the logged in user to save defaults of font color, background color, font style and font size, so when that user logs back in, they will always prompt in the same colors.

The teleprompters tend to be local programs, but with my website I am adding a text editor that allows the user to create and edit text files in the website itself. This allows scripts to be edited from any location, which is more dynamic than all the current teleprompters.

This creation mixes my computer science major and my media minor. With all the code written in PHP, CSS and JavaScript, Smart-Teleprompter fulfills the needs media producers have.
